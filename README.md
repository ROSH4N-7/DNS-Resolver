# DNS-Resolver
This my project for semester 1 for module: Introduction to programming


📋 Description

This is a **user-friendly GUI application** that lets you enter any domain name and instantly get detailed DNS information:

- IP Address
- Reverse DNS (IP → Domain)
- Domain registration date (WHOIS)
- SSL certificate issued & expiry dates

It also keeps a **live history** of every domain you have resolved.
